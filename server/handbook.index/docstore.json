We are excited to begin the 2022-23 school year with you. Each member of the school team (students,\r\nparents, teachers, and staff) has made an informed decision when choosing and committing to be here. As\r\nmembers of this team we will do whatever it takes to ensure the academic, behavioral, and social success of each\r\nindividual student.\r\n\r\nWe stand at a very special point in time. Educational research clearly states that ALL students, regardless of\r\nsocio-economic status or ethnicity, can learn when provided with high expectations, rigorous standards, and\r\nexceptional teaching. There are NO EXCUSES for students, parents, teachers and school administrators.\r\nThere are also no shortcuts on the road to high achievement.","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":59,"to":76}}}}],["5",{"pageContent":"exceptional teaching.

We\r\nmust be able to rely on one another. Our relationships will grow stronger as we build trust and learn to value\r\none another’s unique skills and contributions. Ultimately, our relationships and efforts will continue to yield\r\noutstanding results in student achievement as we have already demonstrated on state-wide measures of student\r\nperformance.\r\n\r\nThere is even greater excitement as we continue with our mission in the 2022-23 school year.

More Time\r\n   We know that there are no shortcuts when it comes to success in academics and life. With an\r\n   extended school day, week, and year, students have more time in the classroom to acquire the\r\n   academic knowledge and skills that prepare them for competitive colleges, as well as more\r\n   opportunities to engage in diverse extracurricular experiences.\r\n\r\n   4.
