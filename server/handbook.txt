Dear Parents and Students,

Welcome! We are excited to begin the 2022-23 school year with you. Each member of the school team (students,
parents, teachers, and staff) has made an informed decision when choosing and committing to be here. As
members of this team we will do whatever it takes to ensure the academic, behavioral, and social success of each
individual student.

We stand at a very special point in time. Educational research clearly states that ALL students, regardless of
socio-economic status or ethnicity, can learn when provided with high expectations, rigorous standards, and
exceptional teaching. There are NO EXCUSES for students, parents, teachers and school administrators.
There are also no shortcuts on the road to high achievement.

To meet this challenge, students, parents, educators and community members must work collaboratively. We
must be able to rely on one another. Our relationships will grow stronger as we build trust and learn to value
one another’s unique skills and contributions. Ultimately, our relationships and efforts will continue to yield
outstanding results in student achievement as we have already demonstrated on state-wide measures of student
performance.

There is even greater excitement as we continue with our mission in the 2022-23 school year. The relentless
efforts of dedicated community members, teachers, staff, and parents will help all Fortune schools become one
of the highest performing school systems in America.

Parental involvement is also a crucial component in creating a learning community that meets the safety and
academic needs of all students. Please read through this handbook carefully and keep it so that you may have it
available for future reference. This handbook has been designed to communicate the basic policies that we all
must follow to ensure that learning remains the focus every minute of each day.

We look forward to working with you to prepare our students to become life-long learners and leaders.

Sincerely,




Dr. Margaret Fortune
President/CEO

                                       EDUCATIONAL PARTNER:




                                                       3
      STUDENT/PARENT HANDBOOK 2022-2023
Mission
   To graduate high-achieving students of good character prepared for college and citizenship in a
   democratic society.

Five Pillars
   1. High Expectations
   All schools in the Fortune network have high expectations for academic achievement and conduct
   that are clearly defined, measurable, and make no excuses based on the background of students.
   Students, parents, teachers, and staff create and reinforce a culture of achievement and support
   through a range of formal and intrinsic rewards and consequences for academic performance and
   behavior.

   2. Choice and Commitment
   Students, their parents, and the staff of every Fortune school choose to participate in the program.
   No one is assigned or forced to attend. Everyone must make and uphold a commitment to the school
   and to each other and must be willing to put in the time and effort required to achieve success.

   3. More Time
   We know that there are no shortcuts when it comes to success in academics and life. With an
   extended school day, week, and year, students have more time in the classroom to acquire the
   academic knowledge and skills that prepare them for competitive colleges, as well as more
   opportunities to engage in diverse extracurricular experiences.

   4. Focus on Results
   We focus relentlessly on high student performance through standardized tests and other objective
   measures. Just as there are no shortcuts, there are no exceptions. Students are expected to
   achieve a level of academic performance that will enable them to succeed in the nation’s best colleges
   and the world beyond.

   5. Citizenship
   We train all students to become leaders and all of our staff shall model leadership qualities.
   Principals are given independent control of staffing and budget decisions. In addition to Principals,
   staff members who demonstrate necessary leadership potential are given responsibilities extending
   beyond a single classroom. Most importantly, students are given leadership development training
   and opportunities to practice leadership skills on a daily basis both inside and outside the
   classroom.

Three Rules
  1. Listen.
  2. Respect.
  3. Work hard.

                                          PARENT INVOLVEMENT
 To put it simply, we cannot provide a high-quality education without including the parent(s) of every student in
 the learning process. Educators and parents cannot work in isolation of each other. In order for learning to take
 place for every student, there must be a continuum of instruction that lasts much longer than the time students
 are in school. By working together as trusted partners, parents and educators can create an educational experience
 for each student that allows learning to continue at home and beyond the classroom walls. Research states that:

     •   When parents are involved, students tend to achieve at higher levels in school, regardless of socio-
         economic status, ethnic/racial background, or parents' education level.
     •   The more extensive the parent involvement, the higher the student achievement.
     •   When parents are involved in students' education, those students generally have higher grades and test
         scores, better attendance, and complete homework more consistently.
     •   Students whose parents are involved in their lives have higher graduation rates and greater enrollment
         rates in postsecondary education.
     •   In programs designed to involve parents in full partnerships, student achievement for disadvantaged
         children not only improves, but can also reach levels that are standard for middle-class children.

 Because of this overwhelming evidence, we believe it is paramount to include parents in the learning process. Upon
 enrollment, parents sign a Commitment to Excellence Contract to provide 40 hours of completely voluntary
 service each year to improve the achievement of their child and the school community. The school also provides
 structures to involve parents in their child’s learning and coordinate parent communication, workshops, activities,
 and clubs to educate, train, and empower parents to better support their child’s pursuit of an excellent education.
 Several of the activities that count as Parent Hours are listed below:

     • Attending Student/Parent/Teacher Conferences and Parent Orientations
     • Participating in Parent Events or Parent Group Meetings
     • Buying healthy food for parent events or for your child’s classroom ($5 = 1 hour)
     • Completing at-home projects for teacher or Parent Liaison (maximum: 30 minutes per day, per child)
     • Helping during Study Hall
     • Homework or reading time at home with your student(s) (maximum: 30 minutes per day, per child)
     • Morning greeting (2 mornings = 1 hour of credit)
     • Set-up/clean-up for school events
     • Tutoring
     • Volunteering in your child’s classroom (when scheduled through teacher)
Students will not be penalized in the event a parent does not fulfill their completely voluntary, 40-hour commitment.

Fortune School encourages parents/guardians and other members of the community to share their time, knowledge
and abilities with our students. Community volunteers in our schools enrich the educational program and strengthen
our schools' relationships with homes, businesses, public agencies and private institutions. By their presence in the
classroom and on school grounds, volunteers may also enhance supervision of students and contribute to school
safety. All parent/guardian volunteers must show proof of being fully vaccinated against COVID-19 and
follow all campus health/safety protocols: wear an N-95, KN-95 or surgical face mask; complete the
campus health screening process; and perform a rapid antigen test provided by the school in order to
serve on campus.

Volunteer Definition: A volunteer is a parent, community member or other adult who assists at a school site or
program on a regular or semi-regular basis. Also included in this definition are those who help on a one-time basis
transporting for official school-related activities/events or working with children without the direct oversight of
certificated staff. Parents who observe or visit their child at school on a regular basis and stay more than 15 minutes
each time are considered volunteers. Volunteer screening, including fingerprinting, is required for all volunteers, at
the volunteer’s expense. Volunteers whose functions require frequent or prolonged contact with students shall also
have on file with Fortune School a certificate showing that, upon initial volunteer assignment, the person submitted
to a tuberculosis risk assessment and, if tuberculosis risk factors were identified, was examined and found to be free
of infectious tuberculosis. If no risk factors are identified, an examination is not required.
                                                          12
Individuals who are at the school to attend or help at a one-time special event involving supervised contact with
children are not considered volunteers by this definition and are not required to be screened. Examples include
helping at a school fair or providing an explanation of their career to a classroom. A parent picking up their child
from school or randomly observing or visiting their child’s classroom is not considered a volunteer.

Department of Justice Checks
Before authorizing any person to serve as a volunteer working with students, the school shall ask the
Department of Justice to conduct an automated records check. Volunteers shall not begin to work with
students until all checks are completed, and shall be informed that the school is conducting this records search.
Volunteers having continuous contact with students (more than 15 minutes) shall undergo fingerprinting
pursuant to Education Code 45125 (Education Code 45106, 45125, 45347, 45349) at their own expense.

A school designee shall ensure that volunteer projects comply with health and safety codes, building codes, fire
codes, and environmental laws. The school will provide on-site assistance and supervision for such projects,
depending upon their complexity and the expertise of the volunteers. Projects shall be inspected upon completion
to ensure that the work was done satisfactorily. Electrical, electronic, heating, ventilation, air conditioning, plumbing,
welding and structural work must be done by a licensed contractor or performed under the supervision of a skilled
maintenance employee with knowledge of the trade involved.

COMPLAINT PROCESS
 Due to the importance of parent involvement in the success of each child parents are expected to communicate
 regularly with their child. Furthermore, parents and teachers need to communicate regularly in order to monitor
 their child’s progress and build a strong partnership with their child’s teacher. In the case that a parent has a
 concern regarding the child’s experience in the classroom parents are asked to follow the steps below:
          1. Discuss the issue with your child.
          2. Meet with the classroom or grade level teacher with your child present.
          3. Meet with the classroom teacher, your child, and the Principal.
          4. Meet with the Principal.
 If the concern is not resolved after the steps above have been followed then parents have the option to proceed
 with the steps below:
          5. Meet with the Principal and President/CEO (or designee) of Fortune School of Education.
          6. Address the Board of Directors for Fortune School of Education.
          7. Address the Sacramento County Office of Education’s Deputy Superintendent’s Office.
          8. Address the Sacramento County Board of Education.
          9. Address the California Department of Education.


                                          GENERAL INFORMATION

 CAMPUS SUPERVISION
 The school opens its doors at 7:15 am each school day and discontinues providing general supervision 15 minutes
 after dismissal time. We are not responsible for general student supervision prior to or after this time. Students
 who are enrolled in and participate in the After School Program will be supervised on campus until a parent or
 guardian picks them up, consistent with the rules for the After School Program. Teachers and staff are responsible
 for student supervision during the school day and during all off-campus field lessons.

 Per the Commitment to Excellence Contract, students are to remain in class until their grade level dismissal
 time. In addition, parents and guardians will be prompt when picking their children up from school or school-
 sponsored field lessons. Families must pick their children up no later than 15 minutes after the dismissal time.
 Students who participate in the After School Program will be supervised on campus until 5:30 pm. On the first
 occurrence of a late pick up, the parent/guardian will be required to meet with the Principal. On the second
 and subsequent occurrences of a late pick up, law enforcement or CPS will be notified if a student is not picked
 up on time from school, field lessons, or the After School Program.


                                                           13
We operate a closed campus. We encourage parents and guardians to visit and help in their student’s classroom.
All visitors, including volunteers, must check-in at the school office prior to visiting classrooms or
volunteering on campus. If a parent/guardian has not been cleared, they cannot be unsupervised or visit for
extended periods on a regular or semi-regular basis. Please see the Parent Involvement section for the related
clearance requirements for volunteers. Visitors are required to wear a sticker that identifies them as a visitor to the
school. Before leaving campus, all visitors and volunteers are required to sign out in the office. All parent/guardian
volunteers must show proof of being fully vaccinated against COVID-19 and follow all campus
health/safety protocols: wear an N-95, KN-95 or surgical face mask; complete the campus health
screening process; and perform a rapid antigen test provided by the school in order to serve on
campus.

PRESCRIPTION MEDICATION
It is discouraged that medications be administered while children are at school. However, we understand that it
sometimes cannot be avoided. In the instance where medication must be administered during school hours, an
Authorization to Administer Medication form must be filled out by the student’s physician or the
medication will not be administered under any circumstances.

For safety reasons, parents must bring all prescription medication to the school office where it is to be stored.
Prescription medications must be in a pharmacy-labeled container that includes the child’s name, medication,
dosage, the prescriber’s name and directions for administration. If there is a need for cough medicine or the like to
be given during school hours, either the parent will need to come to school to administer it, or the parent will
be required to obtain a prescription from the doctor with dosing instructions and the medication will only be
accepted if it has a proper pharmacy label. Non-prescription medication in any form is not permitted on
campus under any circumstances. Scholars are not permitted to self-medicate.

New Authorization to Administer Medication forms must be completed with any changes in medication, dosage or
time to be given. The parent agrees to pick up expired or unused medication within one week of notification and/or
prior to the end of the school year or it will be destroyed.

STUDENT CONDUCT
All schools in the Fortune network have high standards for academic achievement and student conduct that are
clearly defined, measurable and do not allow for excuses based on the background of students. Students are
expected to be responsible for their own behavior. Clear and consistent intrinsic and extrinsic rewards and
consequences are strictly applied and enforced just as they will be in our students’ lives beyond the school campus.

School administrators, teachers and staff will ensure that every student who wants to learn will be able to do so in
a safe, productive, and clean environment. In return, students are expected to work hard, have a positive
attitude, and treat classmates, staff, visitors, and property with kindness, courtesy and respect.

NON-NEGOTIABLE EXPECTATIONS
  1. Commitment to Excellence Contract
  2. School Rules:
     • LISTEN: One person speaks at a time during instructional time. Be on task at all times during class.
        While anyone is speaking, students will always have their eyes, ears, and brains focused on that
        person. This is referred to as “SLANT” and “tracking” the speaker.
     • RESPECT: Be nice. Students must respect themselves, their teachers, fellow students, as well as
        school and personal property.
     • WORK HARD: Learning is hard work. It can also be fun and rewarding. There are no excuses for
        not working hard. Give your best effort at all times.

 ADDITIONAL GUIDELINES
   1. Golden Rule: Treat others like you want others to treat you.
   2. Be organized and prepared for all classes. Work should always be completed on time and presented
      neatly. All personal belongings must be kept neatly in binders, folders, and backpacks.
   3. Respond appropriately to all directions. Non-verbal actions matter.
   4. Do the right thing without being told. “Assign Yourself.”

                                                          14
 FIELD LESSONS
 We provide a variety of opportunities to extend student learning outside the classroom. We call these
 opportunities field lessons. While we expect all students to participate, it is important for students and parents to
 know that basic eligibility requirements apply:
      • No suspensions during the trimester of the Field lesson
      • No more than 3 referrals or major infractions during the trimester of the Field lesson
Any family whose child is ineligible may be permitted to attend a Field lesson if a volunteer-eligible (cleared) family
member accompanies and supervises the student. See the section on Volunteers for more information. Written
and/or verbal notice of ineligible students will be given to both students and families. All parent/guardian
volunteers must show proof of being fully vaccinated against COVID-19 and follow all campus
health/safety protocols: wear an N-95, KN-95 or surgical face mask; complete the campus health
screening process; and perform a rapid antigen test provided by the school in order to serve as a
chaperone.

      prohibited. This includes, but is not limited to: copyrighted material, threatening or obscene material, or
      material protected by trade secret. Use for commercial activities is not acceptable. Use for product
      advertisement or political lobbying is also prohibited. Any transmission reception or web search of
      pornographic material is expressly prohibited and will result in the cancellation of all information

               • Share resources
               • Do not reveal personal information (address, phone numbers, or email)
               • Social networking (i.e. use of Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat, Tik Tok, etc.) is prohibited.
   5. Use of any information obtained via the Internet is at the students’ own risk.
   6. Security: Security on any computer system is a high priority, especially when the system involves many
      users. If you can identify a security problem, notify an administrator or teacher immediately. Do not use
      another individual’s account without written permission from that individual. Attempts to login to any
      network server as a system administrator will result in cancellation of user privileges.
   7. Vandalism: Vandalism will result in cancellation of privileges. Vandalism is defined as any malicious
      attempt to harm or destroy data of another user, hardware, network or any of the above listed agencies
      or other networks that are connected to the Internet. This includes, but is not limited to, the uploading
      or creation of computer viruses or installation of software on school computers by students.

 If parents choose to have their student carry a cellular telephone to and from school for safety purposes, the
 student must check the device according to school site policy. The student may check the telephone out at the
 end of the day. Lost or stolen cell phones are not the responsibility of the school or Fortune School of
 Education.

 STUDENT SEARCHES AND SEIZURES
 Reasonable Suspicion
 A personal search of a student’s person and/or personal effects (e.g., backpack, purse, etc.) may be conducted if a
 school official has reasonable suspicion that the student is engaged in or has engaged in illegal activity or a violation
 of Fortune School rules or regulations. All personal searches should be conducted only by a school
 administrator. For example, students who are suspected to be in possession of contraband that is in violation
 of state or federal law may be searched. A reasonable suspicion is one based upon objective, articulable facts with
 a sufficient probability that the search will reveal evidence the student has violated or is violating the law or Fortune
 School rules or regulations. The scope or extent of the search must also be reasonably related to the reason for
 the search and not excessively intrusive in light of the age and sex of the student and the nature of the infraction.

 Lockers and Desks
 Student lockers and desks are school property and remain at all times under the control of Fortune School.
 Students shall assume full responsibility for the security of their lockers. Student lockers or desks may not be used
 to store illegal, unauthorized, or contraband materials. The acceptance and use of desks or locker facilities on
 campus by any student shall constitute consent by the student to the search of such desk or locker facilities by
 authorized Fortune School personnel and/or law enforcement. Inspections of desks or lockers may be conducted
 by Fortune School personnel and/or law enforcement though the use of trained dogs as described above.

 Seizure of Illegal, Unauthorized, or Contraband Materials
 If a lawfully conducted search yields illegal, unauthorized, or contraband materials, such materials shall be turned
 over to the proper legal authorities for ultimate disposition.

                                         UNIFORMS & DRESS CODE

We believe that a student’s appearance has an impact on his or her attitude and behavior. As a result, all schools in
the Fortune network are uniform schools. Respect for the school community and for the students themselves is
evidenced by dressing appropriately. All students will adhere to a dress code that enhances a professional educational
environment at all times. Students are to wear a school-approved “every day” or “dress” uniform, Monday through
Friday, during off-campus school functions, as well as during Intersession and summer sessions, unless otherwise
specified.
    1. The everyday uniform consists of the following clothing:
         • School color polo shirt with embroidered school logo.
         • Khaki pants, shorts, skirt, scooters, or skorts.
         • All black, closed-toe shoes with all black soles; no Crocs.
         • Dark (navy, black) socks.
         • Black belt.

    2. The dress uniform* consists of the following clothing:
       • Navy blue sweater vest or navy blue cardigan sweater (TK-5) with embroidered school logo.

Middle school scholars must dress down in their P.E. uniforms on each of their designated P.E. days. P.E. shirts and
shorts with the school logo will be issued to scholars. Scholars shall follow policy on the maintenance of school P.E.
uniforms.

DRESS CODE
We prepare our scholars to make positive first impressions. A scholar’s appearance sends a number of subtle, non-
verbal messages. The messages we want our scholars to send are professionalism, confidence and competence. With
that in mind, we expect our scholars to:
    1. Keep their uniform clean and in good repair, and present a neat, well-groomed personal appearance.
    2. All shirts must be tucked in unless otherwise specified (i.e. PE).
    3. Students may not wear inappropriately tight or short shirts, pants, shorts, skirts, scooters, or skorts. If a
         student violates this rule, they must wear a “loaner” uniform article from the office. Inappropriately short
         is defined as any skirt, scooter, skort, or shorts that do not reach the top of the knee. Shorts must be worn
         under skirts.
    4. All pants must fit around the natural waist and not be excessively baggy, and may not cover the shoes.
    5. Belts must be worn through all belt loops and may not cause a distraction to learning.
    6. All clothing must be hemmed. Cut-offs are not allowed.
    7. Students may only wear black or blue jackets/sweatshirts in the winter (no fur or any type of design allowed).
    8. Students may not wear denim clothing (pants, jackets, etc.)
    9. Students may not wear hats, caps, “do” rags, hoods, bandanas, or other head coverings at school, unless
         deemed appropriate. For students with a religious requirement for wearing head covering, this will be
         discussed on a case-by-case basis.
    10. Hair must be worn neatly, in natural hairstyle, and without designs. Braids, locs, and twists are permitted.
         Designs, lines, colored, or bleached hair is not permitted.
    11. For safety reasons, the following jewelry will not be permitted at any Fortune school: chains, chokers,
         multiple-finger rings, toe rings, and large dangling earrings (larger than a quarter).
    12. For safety reasons students must wear closed-toe shoes.
    13. Students may not wear multiple bracelets. (Two maximum, one per wrist.)

         addressed in the Dress Code Policy.


                                                 ATTENDANCE

Students will be in class by 7:45 am every day (Monday – Friday). On specific days when dismissal times change,
families will be given written notice of the adjusted time. Per the Commitment to Excellence Contract, students
are to remain in class until their grade level dismissal time. Parents and guardians will be prompt when picking
their children up from school, the After School Program (if applicable), and/or school-sponsored events.
                                                          17
Families must pick their children up no later than 15 minutes after dismissal. Students who participate in the After
School Program will be supervised on campus until 5:30 pm.

Students will remain in class until dismissal time. Upon their dismissal time, students have 15 minutes to be picked
up or otherwise leave campus without penalty. Past 15 minutes, students remaining on campus without authorization
to do so are considered to be loitering, which is a violation of student conduct and will be addressed accordingly.

HOMEWORK EXPECTATIONS WHEN ABSENT
All missed work due to an excused or unexcused absence(s) must be completed. All work needing completion
or correction must be fixed. Work can increase. It is the student’s responsibility (grades 6-8) to consult with their
teacher(s) to make sure she/he is aware of all assignments. In grades TK-5, the teacher and parent are
responsible for working together to arrange the completion of missed work. The time generally allowed to
complete this work will be the number of days the student was absent. For example, if a student was absent for
one day, then he or she will have one day to make up any missed work.

TARDNESS
Parents and guardians will be prompt when bringing their child to school or to other school-sponsored
events. Repeated tardiness can lead to appropriate consequences determined by the administration due to the
missed learning time. For every 15 minutes a student is late to school, the student will miss 10% of the academic
instruction.

ABSENCES
Excused Absence: Absences for proper causes are listed in the State Educational Code for illness, medical, dental,
or optometry appointments.
Unexcused Absence: Absence which occurs with the knowledge and approval of parents or guardian but for
reasons which, though not acceptable under State Law, are not classified as truancy.

If a student is expected to be absent, parents/guardians must contact the school office by phone the night before or
the day of the expected absence. If a student becomes sick in the morning, the parents/guardians must contact the
school office by 7:30 am. If a student is not in the classroom and the school has not been notified of the absence,
the parent or guardian will be called. Upon the student’s return, the student is expected to bring a signed note from
the parent/guardian or the physician who treated the student, which includes the date or time and a reason
for the absence. All absences must be cleared within 72 hours.

School funding is based on attendance, so accurate record keeping and state law requires parent confirmation of the
reasons for the absences. If your child is ill, it is best for him/her to stay home to get the care needed and prevent
the exposure of illness of others. If for any reason your child is absent from school, please call the school office/or
send a note indicating the reason. The note should state the reason and the dates of absence. State law permits
absences for the following reasons: Illness, quarantine (as directed by the Health Department), medical,
dental or eye appointments, or attending the funeral of an immediate family member.

 FIVE STEP SCHOOL ATTENDANCE REVIEW BOARD (SARB) PROCESS
 All campuses will utilize a School Attendance Review Team (SART). The School Attendance Review Team at the
 school site level will support the school attendance policies and address truancy at all grade levels. The SART will
 convene as needed to review truancy cases. If a student is habitually truant (absent without a valid excuse for 5
 days during the school year), if a student is absent or tardy by more than 30 minutes without a valid excuse on 5
 occasions in a school year, or any combination thereof, a SART hearing will be called. The parent/guardian of the
 habitually truant student will receive notice of the SART hearing and be required to attend. At the SART hearing,
 information will be provided about a student’s attendance record. Parents/guardians will be asked to comment on
 the reasons for the student’s truancy. A parent contract will be developed to bind the parent to bringing their child
 to school on time every day. The SART will make referrals to local agencies as appropriate. Documentation of
 SART proceedings will be included in the child’s cumulative file.



                                                          18
Referral to School Attendance Review Board (SARB)
A SARB will be triggered when a student is classified as a “chronic truant,” meaning a student is absent without a
valid excuse for at least 10% of the school days in one school, from the date of enrollment to the current date. The
SARB will meet as needed to hear cases.

Referral to Appropriate Agencies or County District Attorney:
It is the Charter School’s intent to identify and remove all barriers to the students’ success, and the School will
explore every possible option to address student attendance issues with the family. For any unexcused absence,
the Charter School may refer the family to appropriate school-based and/or social service agencies. If a child’s
attendance does not improve after the SARB Hearing, outlined below, or if the parent fails to attend a required
SARB Hearing, the parent and child may be referred to the District Attorney’s office. Students 12 years of age and
older may be referred to juvenile court for adjudication.

These policies will be enforced fairly, uniformly, and consistently without regard to the characteristics listed in
Education Code 220 (actual or perceived disability, gender, gender identity, gender expression, nationality, race or
ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, or any other characteristic that is contained in the definition of hate crimes
set forth in Section 422.55 of the Penal Code or association with an individual who has any of the aforementioned
characteristics

                                      ACADEMIC INFORMATION
The school’s curriculum is driven by clear content and performance standards for what students should know
and be able to do. For each grade level, standards are based on California state-adopted content standards.
Teachers will use regularly scheduled assessments to measure how well students are mastering the standards.

Teachers use knowledge about student skills to shape whole-class instruction, small-group work, and one-to-
one tutoring. Using individual student data, instruction can be targeted to better meet individual student needs.
Teachers do not simply work to get through a textbook; rather, they establish a big goal for students, diagnose
student skills and needs in order to target instruction appropriately and maximize student achievement toward
the set goal.

Teachers will give students and parents/guardians on-going feedback about student performance. Teachers will
send assessments and progress reports home to be signed consistently throughout the year, as well as class and
homework for parents/guardians to sign. Teachers will contact parents/guardians if they see a slip in academic
performance, students performing below their potential, or a skill that needs extra practice at school and/or
home.

Report cards will be sent home at the end of each trimester and all students will have three student-led
parent/teacher conferences. Parents/guardians will also get feedback about student performance throughout the
year.

COMMUNICATING OVERALL GRADES AND REPORT CARDS
Parents/guardians are required to participate in three Student-led Parent/Teacher Conferences during each
academic year. These conferences are focused on their child’s trimester report card. During this meeting,
parents/guardians will have the opportunity to learn about their child’s academic progress through a student-led
presentation of the report card and samples of student work, as well as receive ideas and instructional materials
to assist their child at home. Parents/guardians and students will also problem-solve with the help of teachers to
determine strategies to maximize the performance of their child.

Students and families will have access to the online gradebooks, via Aeries. Aeries allows parents and students to
access grades and assignments on a real-time basis via the Internet.

HOMEWORK
Homework may be assigned and must be completed on time to ensure that students are maximizing their learning.
Teachers will provide scholars with meaningful feedback on the homework that is assigned. We use homework
for a variety of reasons, all of which align with what is expected of successful college prep-level scholars. We
expect students to complete their homework to prepare for the next day’s lesson, practice skills and reinforce
knowledge learned during the day, and ultimately, establish study habits that will prepare scholars for educational
success.

RESPONSE TO INTERVENTION / MULTI-TIERED SYSTEM OF SUPPORTS
A Multi-Tiered System of Supports (MTSS) is a systematic, continuous improvement framework in which data-
based problem solving and decision making is practiced across all levels of the educational system for supporting
students. Students performing below grade level will receive support using a variety of academic interventions.
Academic interventions are focused on identifying gaps in student’s learning, setting high, standards-based goals
for learning, and relentlessly working to help a student reach grade level proficiency. However, while a student
is receiving intervention instruction, his or her grades will be based on the student’s performance on grade level
standards.
HONOR ROLL PROGRAM (K-5)
The Honor Roll Program is intended to acknowledge student academic excellence. Specifically, it acknowledges
individual high achievement in grade level standards and curricula, which in turn, encourages for each child to
maximize their potential.
Frequency: Honor Roll students will be identified each school trimester.
Elementary Honor Roll Requirements: Students may earn up to 10 honor roll points each trimester. To earn
Honor Roll status, students must achieve a 10/10 or 9/10 on each trimester report card. There are three categories
where Honor Roll points can be earned: Academics (4 points), Attendance (maximum of 3 points), and Leadership
(3 points). In addition, to earn honor roll status students must earn 4 out of 4 academic points and 3 out of 3
leadership points.

MEASUREMENT OF STUDENT PERFORMANCE: ELEMENTARY (K-5)
Student grades will be based on three (3) areas of development: Academics, Attendance and Leadership.

1. Academics (0-4 grade points)
Students can earn 1 grade point for each of the four classes: ELA, Math, Science, and Social Studies. To earn an
academic point for a class a student’s final grade for the trimester must be at 80% or higher. Student performance
on specific academic standards will be assessed through multiple measures, including but not limited to
criterion-referenced tests, portfolios, and rubrics.

         Grades K - 5
          Performance Level             Grade                Assessment

     2. Attendance (0-3 grade points)
        Students can earn 1 grade point for each of the following areas of Attendance:
        Presence: daily attendance in class, students must have no more than 2 unexcused absences in the
        trimester. (Suspensions are considered an unexcused absence.)
        Punctuality: coming to school on time for the trimester. Students must have no more than 6 tardy
        days in the trimester.
        Participation: no more than 4 early dismissals.

    3. Leadership (0-3 grade points)
        Students can earn 1 grade point in each of the following areas of Leadership.
        Citizenship: acceptable behavior for the trimester, meaning at least 90% positive behavior for the
        trimester and no suspensions or expulsions.
        Character: effort and determination to meet academic and behavior goals, meaning 90% on-time
        homework completion for the trimester.
        Service: participation in and completion of community-based service learning projects.

GRADING AND REPORT CARDS (K-5)
The school year is divided into three grading periods (trimesters). The trimesters are long enough (approximately
12 weeks) to allow students multiple opportunities to demonstrate mastery of specific skills. At the end of each
trimester, students will receive OVERALL grades in each of four subjects. The subjects that will be graded are
English Language Arts (ELA), Math, History, and Science. Teachers will clearly state the grading standards
for their class and/or subject area at the beginning of the year.

If a student’s skills are below grade level, he or she will receive instruction using intervention materials.
Academic interventions are focused on: identifying gaps in student’s learning, setting high, standards-based goals for
                                                             21
learning, and relentlessly working to help a student reach grade level proficiency. However, while a student is
receiving intervention instruction, his or her grades will be based on the student’s performance on grade level
standards.

Final Grades
Students’ final grades are based on student performance in Academics, Attendance, and Leadership.

Promotion to the Next Grade (K-5)
To be promoted to the next grade level, students must be at (or demonstrate significant progress toward) the
Proficient level (70%) or above in Academics, and meet Attendance and Leadership goals.

MEASUREMENT OF STUDENT PERFORMANCE: MIDDLE SCHOOL (6-8)
Students will be graded in the following subject areas: ELA, Math, Science, Social Studies/Humanities, Physical
Education and Electives. Student performance on specific academic standards will be assessed through multiple
measures, including but not limited to criterion-referenced tests, quizzes, homework, etc.

     PERFORMANCE LEVEL                      ASSESSMENT AVERAGE                      GRADE (GRADE POINTS)

Saturday School / Intersession
More time can be offered to students who need it to master their grade level standards. In some cases, students
may be required to attend extra hours after school, Saturday School, or during Intersession. In each case,
participation criteria and requirements will be communicated to students and parents ahead of time.

Grading and Report Cards (6-8)
Grading periods are approximately 12 weeks long. Each12 weeks is a Trimester, and there are three trimesters in
the school year. At the end of each trimester, students will receive overall grades in ELA, Math, History/Humanities,
Science, P.E., and Electives. Teachers will clearly state the grading policies for their class and/or subject area at the
beginning of the year. Parents can keep track of student grades via Aeries. Official report cards will be distributed
during student-led parent/teacher conferences. See the School Calendar for a timeline for conference dates.

HONOR ROLL PROGRAM (6-8)
The Honor Roll Program is intended to acknowledge student academic excellence. Specifically, it acknowledges
individual high achievement in grade level standards and curricula, which in turn, encourages for each child to
maximize their potential.

Frequency: Honor Roll students will be identified each school trimester.
Middle School Honor Roll Requirements: Students may earn up to 7 honor roll points each trimester. To
earn Honor Roll status, students must achieve a 7/7 or 6/7 on each trimester report card. There are three categories
where Honor Roll points can be earned: Academics (1 point), Attendance (maximum of 3 points), and Leadership
(3 points). In addition, to earn honor roll status students must earn 1 out of 1 academic points and 3 out of 3
leadership points. Students must earn all points for Academics and Leadership, and may lose only 1 point for
Attendance for be eligible for Honor Roll.

                            GENERAL INFORMATION – ALL SCHOLARS

STUDENT SUPPLIES
Each student in grades 6-8 will be given a school-issued, branded binder. Students are expected to come to class
prepared with the school supplies needed to participate for their individual use.

CLOSED CAMPUS POLICY
All schools in the Fortune network are closed campuses. This means that students are to remain on campus
once they have entered the school premises. Students are not permitted to leave school grounds without first
clearing through the office. Only a parent or guardian listed on the Emergency Contacts (see student enrollment
application) may sign the student out from school. Notes are not accepted. Parents/guardians should be
prepared to show their photo ID to the classroom teacher for the first 10 days of school, and should be
prepared to show their ID to a substitute teacher if there is one present.

DAILY DISMISSAL
Per the Commitment to Excellence Contract, students are to remain in class until their grade level dismissal
time. Parents and guardians will be prompt when picking their children up from school, the After School
Program (if applicable), and/or school-sponsored events. Families must pick their children up no later than 15
minutes after dismissal. Students who participate in the After School Program will be supervised on campus until
5:30 pm. On the first occurrence of a late pick up, the parent/guardian will be required to meet with the
Principal. On the second and subsequent occurrences of a late pick up, law enforcement or CPS will be
notified if a student is not picked up on time from school, field lessons, or the After School Program.

TELEPHONE USE
Students may not use any school phone or staff cellular phone without permission from a staff member.
Students will only be allowed to use the phone when deemed necessary by a staff member. A teacher or
staff member must be present at the time of the call. At times, the teacher will dial the number for a
student. Students who use a phone without permission from a teacher will be subject to appropriate
consequences.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a student shall not be prohibited from possessing or using a cellular telephone in
the following circumstances:
            1. In the case of an emergency, or in response to a perceived threat of danger.
            2. When a teacher or administrator grants permission, subject to any reasonable limitation imposed
                 by that teacher or administrator.
            3. When a licensed physician and surgeon determines that the possession or use is necessary for
                 the health or well-being of the student.
            4. When the possession or use is required in a student’s individualized education program.

HUMAN RIGHTS POLICY
Our campus brings together a diverse group of individuals. We are guided by the principle that respect and
consideration for all individuals is foremost in all school activities. It is unlawful to discriminate against any
individual based on disability, gender, gender identity, gender expression, nationality, race or ethnicity, religion,
sexual orientation, or any other characteristic that is contained in the definition of hate crimes set forth in Section
422.55 of the Penal Code, including immigration status, in any program or activity conducted by an educational
institution that receives, or benefits from, state financial assistance or enrolls pupils who receive state student

financial aid. It is the responsibility of every member of the school community to observe and uphold the
principles of equal opportunity as they affect staff, faculty and students in all aspects of school life. It is the
responsibility of every member of the school community to actively promote appropriate workplace behavior.
Any form of coercion or harassment that insults the dignity of others or impedes their freedom to work and
learn will not be tolerated. Any such form of coercion or harassment will result in appropriate discipline, up to
and including, expulsion.

HUMAN TRAFFICKING
Human trafficking is modern slavery. It involves exploiting a person through force, fraud, or coercion for the
purpose of forced labor, commercial sex, or both. Victims of human trafficking include men, women, boys, girls,
and transgender individuals lured by the promise of a better life in the United States as well as adults and children
who were born and raised in the United States. Few crimes are more abhorrent than child trafficking, and few
crimes are more challenging for communities to recognize and address. For many people, the reality of trafficking
in their community is difficult to comprehend, let alone confront. For educators and school personnel, the reality
of these crimes and the severity of their impact are cause for a call to action. Source: National Center on Safe,
Supportive Learning Environments

 PLAGIARISM/CHEATING
 Plagiarism occurs when a student uses another writer’s work without giving credit for the source. Plagiarism
 typically occurs in school situations in the following ways:
    • A student uses the author’s words without using quotation marks around the material.
    • A student uses an electronic source (internet, television, lyrics) without citing the source.
    • A student uses the author’s ideas or information without giving credit for the material (known in the
         academic world as “citing the source”).
    • A student does both—uses the author’s words and ideas without citing the source.

 Cheating can take many forms but always involves taking information from another student or individual.
 Examples of cheating can include but are not limited to:
    • taking answers on a test, homework, or quiz from another student or other source, with or without the
       other student’s knowledge;
    • collaboration on assignments such as taking or sharing answers without teacher permission;
    • obtaining test answers and/or questions from other students in advance of an exam;
    • stealing test materials;
    • falsifying grade reports or changing a grade book;
    • taking pictures of an exam and forwarding the pictures to anyone;
    • texting answers or questions to anyone.

 Cheating can be accomplished by several means, including but not limited to: deception, theft, talking, signs,

                                       DISCIPLINARY PROCEDURES

Every school in the Fortune network has a Commitment to Excellence Contract that governs the relationships
for the school, parents and students. The contract also includes language governing parent conduct on campus. If
a student is in violation of a school rule or policy, a teacher orstaff member will refer him/her to the appropriate
administrator to determine the consequences based on the type and severity of the violation.

Corporal punishment will not be permitted at any FSE charter school. Any employee who is determinedto have
engaged in such action will be terminated immediately. Corporal punishment includes the willfulinfliction of or
willfully causing the infliction of physical pain on a student. For purposes of this policy, corporal punishment does
not include an employee’s use of force that is reasonable and necessary to protect the employee, students, staff or
other persons or to prevent damage to school property.

SUSPENSION/EXPULSION
The Charter School administration shall ensure that students and their parents/guardians are notified inwriting upon
enrollment of all discipline and involuntary removal policies and procedures. The notice shall state that this policy
and its procedures are available upon request in the school office.

Suspended or expelled students shall be excluded from all school and school-related activities unless otherwise
agreed during the period of suspension or expulsion.

A student identified as an individual with disabilities or for whom the Charter School has a basis of knowledge of a
suspected disability pursuant to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004 or who is
qualified for services under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 is subject to the same grounds for
suspension and expulsion and is accorded the same due process procedures applicable to general education students
except when federal and state law mandates additional or differentprocedures. The Charter School will follow all
applicable federal and state laws including but not limited to the applicable provisions of the California Education
Code, when imposing any form of discipline on a student identified as an individual with disabilities or for whom the
Charter School has a basis of knowledgeof a suspected disability or who is otherwise qualified for such services or
protections in according due process to such students.

No student shall be involuntarily removed by the Charter School for any reason unless the parent/guardianof the
student has been provided written notice of intent to remove the student no less than five (5) schooldays before the
effective date of the action. The written notice shall be in the native language of the student or the student’s
parent/guardian or, if the student is a foster child or youth or a homeless child or youth, the student’s educational
rights holder, and shall inform the student, the student’s parent/guardian, or educational rights holder of the basis
for which the student is being involuntarily removed and the student’s parent/guardian, or educational rights
holder’s right to request a hearing to challenge the involuntary removal.

If a student’s parent, guardian, or educational rights holder requests a hearing, the Charter School shall utilize the
same hearing procedures specified below for expulsions, before the effective date of the actionto involuntarily
remove the student. If the student’s parent, guardian, or educational rights holder requestsa hearing, the student
shall remain enrolled and shall not be removed until the Charter School issues a finaldecision. As used herein,
“involuntarily removed” includes disenrolled, dismissed, transferred, or terminated, but does not include removals
for misconduct which may be grounds for suspension or expulsion as enumerated below.

Grounds for Suspension and Expulsion
A student may be suspended from school or recommended for expulsion if the Principal determines that the
student has committed a prohibited act outlined in Education Code Section 48900 or otherwiseidentified in the
Charter School’s Discipline Matrix. A student shall be immediately suspended and shall be recommended for
expulsion if the Principal determines that the student has committed an act under Education Code Section
48915(c).


                                                         26
Due Process Protections
Prior to student discipline, especially those involving suspension or expulsion or other limitation of fundamentally
protected student rights, every student will have access to the maximum due process protections provided under
the law, within the context of the circumstances. Students who are being considered for suspension and expulsion
will be provided the specific due process protections providedbelow to safeguard the student’s interests within
the situation.

Suspension Procedure
Suspensions shall be initiated according to the following procedures:

Conference
Suspension shall be preceded, if possible, by a conference conducted by the Principal or designee withthe student
and the student’s parent/guardian, and whenever practical, the teacher, supervisor or Charter School employee
who referred the student to the Principal. The conference may be omitted if the Principal or designee determines
that an emergency situation exists. An “emergency situation” involvesa clear and present danger to the lives, safety
or health of students or Charter School personnel. If a student is suspended without this conference, both the
parent/guardian and student shall be notified of the student’s right to return to school for the purpose of a
conference.

At the conference, the student shall be informed of the reason for the disciplinary action and the evidence against
the student and shall be given the opportunity to present their version and evidence intheir defense, in accordance
with Education Code Section 47605.6(b)(5)(J)(i). This conference shall be held within two (2) school days, unless
the student waives this right or is physically unable to attend for any reason including, but not limited to,
incarceration or hospitalization. No penalties may be imposed on a student for failure of the student’s parent or
guardian to attend a conference with Charter Schoolofficials. Reinstatement of the suspended student shall not be
contingent upon attendance by the student’s parent/guardian at the conference.

Notice to Parents/Guardians
At the time of the suspension, a Charter School employee shall make a reasonable effort to contact the
parent/guardian by telephone or in person. Whenever a student is suspended, the parent/guardian shall benotified
in writing of the suspension. This notice shall state the specific offense committed by the student.In addition, the
notice may also state the date and time when the student may return to school. If school officials wish to ask the
parent/guardian to confer regarding matters pertinent to the suspension, the noticemay add that state law requires
the parent/guardian to respond to such requests without delay.

Homework Assignments During Suspension
In accordance with Education Code Section 47606.2(a), upon the request of a parent, a legal guardian or other
person holding the right to make education decisions for the student, or the affected student,a teacher shall
provide to a student in any of grades 1 to 12, inclusive, who has been suspended from school for two (2) or more
school days, the homework that the student would otherwise have been assigned.

In accordance with Education Code Section 47606.2(b), if a homework assignment that is requested pursuant to
Section 47606.2(a) and turned into the teacher by the student either upon the student’sreturn to school from
suspension or within the timeframe originally prescribed by the teacher, whicheveris later, is not graded before the
end of the academic term, that assignment shall not be included in thecalculation of the student’s overall grade in
the class.

Suspension Time Limits/Recommendation for Expulsion
Suspensions, when not including a recommendation for expulsion, shall not exceed five (5) consecutiveschool days
per suspension. Upon a recommendation of expulsion by the Principal or designee, the student and the student’s
parent/guardian or representative will be invited to a conference to determineif the suspension for the student
should be extended pending an expulsion hearing. In such instanceswhen the Charter School has determined a
suspension period shall be extended, such extension shall bemade only after a conference is held with the student
or the student’s parent/guardian, unless the studentand the student’s parent/guardian fail to attend the conference.
                                                        27
This determination will be made by the Principal or designee upon either of the following: 1) the student’spresence
will be disruptive to the education process; or 2) the student poses a threat or danger to others. Upon either
determination, the student’s suspension will be extended pending the results of an expulsionhearing.

Authority to Expel
As required by Education Code Section 47605.6(b)(5)(J)(ii), students recommended for expulsion are entitled to
a hearing adjudicated by a neutral officer to determine whether the student should be expelled. The procedures
herein provide for such a hearing and the notice of said hearing, as required by law.

Only the neutral and impartial Fortune School of Education Board of Directors, upon the recommendation of the
expulsion panel, may expel a student. The governing board and the expulsion panel shall be presided over by a
designated neutral hearing chairperson. The governing board may expelany student found to have committed an
expellable offense(s) listed in Education Code Section 48900, as stated in the “Grounds for Suspension and
Expulsion” above.

Except for expulsions for offenses listed under Education Code Section 48915(c), a student may only beexpelled
upon the findings and recommendations of the expulsion panel if the governing board finds that the student
committed the expellable offense and at least one of the following findings may be substantiated:
     1. That other means of correction are not feasible or have repeatedly failed to bring about properconduct.
    2. That due to the nature of the violation, the presence of the student causes a continuing danger tothe
    physical safety of the student or others.

Expulsion Procedure
Students recommended for expulsion are entitled to a hearing to determine whether the student shouldbe expelled.
Unless postponed for good cause, the hearing shall be held within thirty (30) school days after the Charter School
Principal or designee determines that the student has committed an expellableoffense under the “Grounds for
Suspension and Expulsion” and recommends the student for expulsion.

The hearing will be conducted by the expulsion panel. The Charter School Principal will make a recommendation
for expulsion to the expulsion panel. The expulsion panel shall be comprised of at leastthree members who are
certificated and neither a teacher of the student nor a member of the CharterSchool’s Board. The hearing shall
be held in closed session (complying with all student confidentiality rules under the Family Educational Rights and
Privacy Act (“FERPA”) unless the student makes a writtenrequest for a public hearing in open session three (3)
days prior to the date of the scheduled hearing.

Written notice of the hearing shall be forwarded to the student and the student’s parent/guardian at least ten (10)
calendar days before the date of the hearing. Upon mailing the notice, it shall be deemed served upon the student.
The notice shall include:
     1. The date and place of the hearing;
     2. A statement of the specific facts, charges and offense upon which the proposed expulsion isbased;
     3. A copy of the charter school’s disciplinary rules which relate to the alleged violation;
     4. Notification of the student’s or parent/guardian’s obligation to provide information about thestudent’s
          status to any other district in which the student seeks enrollment;
     5. The opportunity for the student and/or the student’s parent/guardian to appear in person or toemploy
           and be represented by counsel or a non-attorney advisor;
     6. The right to inspect and obtain copies of all documents to be used at the hearing;
     7. The opportunity to confront and question all witnesses who testify at the hearing; and
     8. The opportunity to question all evidence presented and to present oral and documentaryevidence on
          the student’s behalf including witnesses.

Special Procedures for Expulsion Hearings Involving Sexual Assault or Battery Offenses The Charter School may,
upon a finding of good cause, determine that the disclosure of either theidentity of the witness or the testimony

                                                        28
of that witness at the hearing, or both, would subject the witnessto an unreasonable risk of psychological or physical
harm. Upon this determination, the testimony of thewitness may be presented at the hearing in the form of sworn
declarations that shall be examined onlyby the Charter School or the hearing officer.

Copies of these sworn declarations, edited to delete the name and identity of the witness, shall be made available
to the student.
     1. The complaining witness in any sexual assault or battery case must be provided with a copy of the
           applicable disciplinary rules and advised of their right to (a) receive five (5) days notice of their
           scheduled testimony; (b) have up to two (2) adult support persons of their choosing present in the
           hearing at the time the complaining witness testifies, which may include a parent/guardian, orlegal
           counsel; and (c) elect to have the hearing closed while testifying.
     2. The Charter School must also provide the victim a room separate from the hearing room for the
           complaining witness’ use prior to and during breaks in testimony.
     3. At the discretion of the entity conducting the expulsion hearing, the complaining witness shall be
           allowed periods of relief from examination and cross-examination during which the complaining
           witness may leave the hearing room.
     4. The entity conducting the expulsion hearing may also arrange the seating within the hearing roomto
           facilitate a less intimidating environment for the complaining witness.
     5. The entity conducting the expulsion hearing may also limit time for taking the testimony of the
           complaining witness to the hours the complaining witness is normally in school, if there is no good
           cause to take the testimony during other hours.
     6. Prior to a complaining witness testifying, the support persons must be admonished that the hearingis
           confidential. Nothing in the law precludes the entity presiding over the hearing from removing a
           support person whom the presiding person finds is disrupting the hearing. The entity conductingthe
           hearing may permit any one of the support persons for the complaining witness to accompanythe
           complaining witness to the witness stand.
     7. If one or both of the support persons is also a witness, the Charter School must present evidencethat
           the witness’ presence is both desired by the witness and will be helpful to the Charter School.The
           entity presiding over the hearing shall permit the witness to stay unless it is established that there is a
           substantial risk that the testimony of the complaining witness would be influenced by thesupport
           person, in which case the presiding official shall admonish the support person or personsnot to
           prompt, sway, or influence the witness in any way. Nothing shall preclude the presiding officer from
           exercising their discretion to remove a person from the hearing whom they believe is prompting,
           swaying, or influencing the witness.
     8. The testimony of the support person shall be presented before the testimony of the complaining
           witness and the complaining witness shall be excluded from the courtroom during that testimony.
     9. Especially for charges involving sexual assault or battery, if the hearing is to be conducted in publicat
           the request of the student being expelled, the complaining witness shall have the right to have their
           testimony heard in a closed session when testifying at a public meeting would threaten serious
           psychological harm to the complaining witness and there are no alternative procedures to avoid the
           threatened harm. The alternative procedures may include videotaped depositions or
           contemporaneous examination in another place communicated to the hearing room by means of
           closed-circuit television.
     10. Evidence of specific instances of a complaining witness’ prior sexual conduct is presumedinadmissible
           and shall not be heard absent a determination by the entity conducting the hearing that extraordinary
           circumstances exist requiring the evidence be heard. Before such a determination regarding
           extraordinary circumstances can be made, the witness shall be providednotice and an opportunity to
           present opposition to the introduction of the evidence. In the hearingon the admissibility of the
           evidence, the complaining witness shall be entitled to be represented by a parent, legal counsel, or
           other support person. Reputation or opinion evidence regarding thesexual behavior of the
           complaining witness is not admissible for any purpose.

Special Procedures for the Consideration of Suspension and Expulsion or Involuntary Removal of Students with
Disabilities

Notification of SELPA
The Charter School shall immediately notify the SELPA and coordinate the procedures in this policy withthe
SELPA of the discipline of any student with a disability or student that the Charter School or the SELPAwould be
deemed to have knowledge that the student had a disability.

Services During Suspension
Students suspended for more than ten (10) school days in a school year shall continue to receive services so as
to enable the student to continue to participate in the general education curriculum, although in another setting
(which could constitute a change of placement and the student’s IEP would reflect this change), and to progress
toward meeting the goals set out in the child’s IEP/504 Plan; and receive, as appropriate, a functional behavioral
assessment and behavioral intervention services and modifications, thatare designed to address the behavior
violation so that it does not recur. These services may be provided inan interim alternative educational setting.

Procedural Safeguards/Manifestation Determination
Within ten (10) school days of a recommendation for expulsion or any decision to change the placement of a
child with a disability because of a violation of a code of student conduct, the Charter School, the parent, and
relevant members of the IEP/504 Team shall review all relevant information in the student’s file, including the
child’s IEP/504 Plan, any teacher observations, and any relevant information provided by the parents to
determine:
             a. If the conduct in question was caused by, or had a direct and substantial relationship to,
                 the child’s disability; or
             b. If the conduct in question was the direct result of the local educational agency’s failure to
                 implement the IEP/504 Plan.

If the Charter School, the parent, and relevant members of the IEP/504 Team determine that either of theabove
is applicable for the child, the conduct shall be determined to be a manifestation of the child’s disability.

If the Charter School, the parent, and relevant members of the IEP/504 Team make the determination thatthe
conduct was a manifestation of the child’s disability, the IEP/504 Team shall:
            a. Conduct a functional behavioral assessment and implement a behavioral intervention plan for
                such child, provided that the Charter School had not conducted such assessment prior to
                such determination before the behavior that resulted in a change in placement;
            b. If a behavioral intervention plan has been developed, review the behavioral intervention planif
                the child already has such a behavioral intervention plan, and modify it, as necessary, to
                address the behavior; and
            c. Return the child to the placement from which the child was removed, unless the
                parent/guardian and the Charter School agree to a change of placement as part of the
                modification of the behavioral intervention plan.

If the Charter School, the parent/guardian, and relevant members of the IEP/504 Team determine that the
behavior was not a manifestation of the student’s disability and that the conduct in question was not a directresult
of the failure to implement the IEP/504 Plan, then the Charter School may apply the relevant disciplinary
procedures to children with disabilities in the same manner and for the same duration as theprocedures would
be applied to students without disabilities.

Due Process Appeals
The parent/guardian of a child with a disability who disagrees with any decision regarding placement, or the
manifestation determination, or the Charter School believes that maintaining the current placement ofthe child is
substantially likely to result in injury to the child or to others, may request an expedited administrative hearing
through the Special Education Unit of the Office of Administrative Hearings or by utilizing the dispute provisions
of the 504 Policy and Procedures.
                                                           30
When an appeal relating to the placement of the student or the manifestation determination has been requested
by either the parent/guardian or the Charter School, the student shall remain in the interim alternative educational
setting pending the decision of the hearing officer in accordance with state and federal law, including 20 U.S.C.
Section 1415(k), until the expiration of the forty-five (45) day time periodprovided for in an interim alternative
educational setting, unless the parent/guardian and the Charter Schoolagree otherwise.

In accordance with 20 U.S.C. Section 1415(k)(3), if a parent/guardian disagrees with any decision regarding
placement, or the manifestation determination, or if the Charter School believes that maintaining the current
placement of the child is substantially likely to result in injury to the child or to others, the parent/guardian or
Charter School may request a hearing. In such an appeal, a hearing officer may: (1) return a child with a disability
to the placement from which the child was removed; or (2) order a changein placement of a child with a disability
to an appropriate interim alternative educational setting for not more than 45 school days if the hearing officer
determines that maintaining the current placement of suchchild is substantially likely to result in injury to the child
or to others.

Special Circumstances
Charter School personnel may consider any unique circumstances on a case-by-case basis when determining
whether to order a change in placement for a child with a disability who violates a code of student conduct.
The Principal or designee may remove a student to an interim alternative educational setting for not morethan
forty-five (45) school days without regard to whether the behavior is determined to be a manifestation of the
student’s disability in cases where a student:
             a. Carries or possesses a weapon, as defined in 18 U.S.C. Section 930, to or at school, onschool
                  premises, or to or at a school function;
             b. Knowingly possesses or uses illegal drugs, or sells or solicits the sale of a controlledsubstance,
                  while at school, on school premises, or at a school function; or
             c. Has inflicted serious bodily injury, as defined by 20 U.S.C. Section 1415(k)(7)(D), upon aperson
                  while at school, on school premises, or at a school function.

Interim Alternative Educational Setting
The student’s interim alternative educational setting shall be determined by the student’s IEP/504 Team.

Procedures for Students Not Yet Eligible for Special Education Services
A student who has not been identified as an individual with disabilities pursuant to IDEA and who has
violated the Charter School’s disciplinary procedures may assert the procedural safeguards granted under this
administrative regulation only if the Charter School had knowledge that the student was disabled before the
behavior occurred. The Charter School shall be deemed to have knowledge that the student had a disability if one
of the following conditions exists:
             a. The parent/guardian has expressed concern in writing, or orally if the parent/guardian doesnot
                 know how to write or has a disability that prevents a written statement, to Charter School
                 supervisory or administrative personnel, or to one of the child’s teachers, that the student is in
                 need of special education or related services.
             b. The parent/guardian has requested an evaluation of the child.
             c. The child’s teacher, or other Charter School personnel, has expressed specific concernsabout a
                 pattern of behavior demonstrated by the child, directly to the director of specialeducation or to
                 other Charter School supervisory personnel.

If the Charter School knew or should have known the student had a disability under any of the three (3)
circumstances described above, the student may assert any of the protections available to IDEA- eligible children
with disabilities, including the right to stay-put. If the Charter School had no basis for knowledgeof the student’s
disability, it shall proceed with the proposed discipline. The Charter School shall conductan expedited evaluation
if requested by the parents; however, the student shall remain in the education placement determined by the
Charter School pending the results of the evaluation. The Charter School shall not be deemed to have knowledge
that the student had a disability if the parent/guardian has not allowed an evaluation, refused services, or if the
                                                          31
student has been evaluated and determined to not be eligible.

Record of Hearing
A record of the hearing shall be made and may be maintained by any means, including electronic recording, as long
as a reasonably accurate and complete written transcription of the proceedings can be made.

Presentation of Evidence
While technical rules of evidence do not apply to an expulsion hearing, evidence may be admitted and used as
proof only if it is the kind of evidence on which reasonable persons can rely in the conduct of serious affairs. A
recommendation by the expulsion panel to expel must be supported by substantial evidence that the student
committed any of the acts listed in the “Grounds for Suspension and Expulsion.”

Finding of facts shall be based solely on the evidence at the hearing. While hearsay evidence is admissible,no decision
to expel shall be based solely on hearsay. Sworn declarations may be admitted as testimonyfrom witnesses of
whom the Board or expulsion panel determines that disclosure of their identity or testimony at the hearing may
subject them to an unreasonable risk of physical or psychological harm. If, due to a written request by the expelled
student, the hearing is held at a public meeting, and the charge is committing or attempting to commit a sexual
assault or committing a sexual battery as definedin Education Code Section 48900, a complaining witness shall have
the right to have their testimony heard in a session closed to the public.

Expulsion Decision
The decision of the expulsion panel shall be in the form of written findings of fact and a written recommendation
to the governing board which will make a final determination regarding the expulsion.The Board of Directors shall
make the final determination regarding the expulsion within ten (10) schooldays following the conclusion of the
hearing. The decision of the Board of Directors is final.

If the expulsion panel decides not to recommend expulsion, or the Board of Directors ultimately decidesnot to
expel, the student shall immediately be returned to their previous educational program. The Board of Directors
may also determine to suspend the enforcement of the expulsion order for a periodof not more than one (1)
calendar year from the date of the expulsion hearing and return the student to the student’s previous educational
program under a probationary status and rehabilitation plan to bedetermined by the Board. During the period of
the suspension of the expulsion order, the student is deemed to be on probationary status. The Board of Directors
may revoke the suspension of an expulsionorder under this section if the student commits any of the enumerated
offenses listed above or violatesany of the Charter School’s rules and regulations governing student conduct. If
the Board revokes the suspension of an expulsion order, the student may be expelled under the terms of the
original expulsionorder. The Board of Directors shall apply the criteria for suspending the enforcement of the
expulsion order equally to all students, including individuals with exceptional needs as defined in Education Code
Section 56026. The Board of Directors shall further comply with the provisions set forth under Education Code
Section 48917, except as otherwise expressly set forth herein.

Written Notice to Expel
The Principal or designee following a decision of the governing board to expel, shall send written noticeof the
decision to expel, including the Board’s adopted findings of fact, to the student and student’s parent/guardian. This
notice shall include the following:
  1.      The specific offense committed by the student under the “Grounds for Suspension and Expulsion”;
  2.      Notice of the student’s right to appeal the expulsion; and
  3.      Notice of the student’s or parent/guardian’s obligation to inform any new district in which the student
          seeks to enroll of the student’s status with the Charter School.

The Principal, or designee, shall send written notice of the decision to expel to the student’s district ofresidence
and the Sacramento County Office of Education. This notice shall include the following:
  1.    The student’s name; and
  2.    The specific offense committed by the student.

                                                          32
Upon expulsion from the Charter School, students will be referred to their district of residence toattend
school pursuant to the procedure of their district of residence pertaining to expelled students.

Additional Due Process Rights
Every student is entitled under fundamental principles of due process to know precisely what conduct is prohibited
prior to being disciplined for such conduct, and to possess ample opportunity to review the evidence presented
and provide a response to such evidence. The due process protections affordedto students prior to suspension
and expulsion are provided above, and further rights, such as the right to appeal, record-keeping, and rehabilitation
and re-admittance are included below.

Appeal Rights
Following receipt of the notice of expulsion or suspension, the student shall have the right to appeal thatdecision to
the full Fortune School of Education Board of Directors. The student shall have 10 days topresent their intention
to appeal the decision. Upon the appeal, the student shall have the right to a denovo review in front of the full
governing board in closed session, including the full complement of dueprocess rights available to the student
during the initial hearing. The full governing board will then render a final decision regarding the student’s appeal.

Disciplinary Records
The Charter School shall maintain records of all student suspensions and expulsions at the Charter School. Such
records shall be made available for the chartering authority’s review upon request, but neither the chartering
authority shall be involved in the disciplinary decision.

Expelled Students/Alternative Education
Parents/guardians of students who are expelled shall be responsible for seeking alternative education programs
including but not limited to programs within the County or their school district of residence. The Charter School
shall work cooperatively with parents/guardians as requested by parents/guardians or by the school district of
residence to assist with locating alternative placements during expulsion.

Rehabilitation Plans
Students who are expelled shall be given a rehabilitation plan upon expulsion as developed by the governing board
at the time of the expulsion order, which may include, but is not limited to, periodic review as well as assessment
at the time of review for readmission. The rehabilitation plan should includea date not later than one (1) year from
the date of expulsion when the student may reapply for readmission.

Readmission or Admission of Previously Expelled Student
The decision to readmit a student after the end of the student’s expulsion term or to admit a previously
expelled student from another school district or charter school who has not been readmitted/admitted to another
school or school district after the end of the student’s expulsion term, shall be in the sole discretionof the governing
board following a meeting with the Principal and the student and student’s parent/guardianor representative, to
determine whether the student has successfully completed the rehabilitation plan andto determine whether the
student poses a threat to others or will be disruptive to the school environment.The Principal or designee shall
make a recommendation to the governing board following the meetingregarding the Principal’s or designee’s
determination. The Board shall then make a final decision regardingreadmission or admission of the student
during the closed session of a public meeting, reporting out anyaction taken during closed session consistent
with the requirements of the Brown Act. The student’sreadmission is also contingent upon the Charter
School’s capacity at the time the student seeks readmissionor admission to the Charter School.

Notice to Teachers
The Charter School shall notify teachers of each student who has engaged in or is reasonably suspectedto have
engaged in any of the acts listed in Education Code Section 49079 and the corresponding enumerated offenses set

CONSEQUENCES FOR NOT ADHERING TO THE COMMITMENT TO EXCELLENCE
CONTRACT OR SCHOOL RULES
We consider the totality of the circumstances and anticipate that students will make mistakes. Our desire is that
students learn from those mistakes and grow to become responsible young adults who can make positive choices
for themselves. Therefore, we will work with students to help them learn self-discipline by way of holding them
accountable for their actions.

Minor Violations
   • Students will receive progressive discipline in response to negative behavior. The first minor offense where
      the teacher needs to directly address the student will result in a consequence that includes the loss of a
      citizenship point (e.g. loss of paycheck dollars, loss of behavior color, loss of Dojo point).

Repeated Violations
Students who fail to respond to teacher interventions to Minor Violations and do not correct their behavior
should expect the following:
    • Sent to the Porch
    • Completion of a letter of apology, verbal apology, or reflection journal
    • Loss of further privileges, such as participation in activities, incentives or field lessons
    • Parent-Teacher conference / Student Success Team Meeting
    • Reclassification as a Major Violation and Officer Referral

Major Violations
See Discipline Matrix.

THE PORCH
The “Porch” is one of the consequences for not adhering to expectations and the Commitment to Excellence
Contract. The Porch means that the student must work in isolation in the classroom. Instead of sitting with the
group, the student sits apart from the other students. During their time on the Porch, students re-learn
the expectations of each member of the team, and the value of making good choices.

This consequence ends when the teacher(s) see improvement in student conduct (listening, following directions,
respect for self and others, completion of all assigned work). Although, the student is on the Porch, the student
still receives all instruction and is expected to complete the same class work and homework, but the student
works alone. Furthermore, a student on the Porch:
      •    Eats at a separate table or room at lunch and breakfast
      •    Loses other school privileges
Students on the Porch must ask permission from the teacher to enter and leave a classroom. This enables the
teachers to more effectively monitor their actions and provide a re-focus at the beginning of every class period.
Students on the Porch are excluded from certain field lessons and other school privileges.

There are two (2) reasons for the existence of the Porch. First, this reinforces the basic reward and consequence
system of the school and life in general: good things happen when an individual makes the right choices and negative
things happen when an individual makes poor choices. Second, the school places a high value on the concept of
TEAM. Students are expected to contribute to the team of students and teachers by respecting others and doing
their share of the work. The Porch is a consequence where all the benefits of the TEAM are taken away and thus,
the student comes to value the advantages of being a member of the school’s TEAM.

FIGHTING
The first time a student chooses to fight, the student will be immediately referred to an administrator and
suspended from classes for a minimum of the remainder of the day and the next day. Consult the Discipline Matrix
for the consequences of fighting and the escalation of those consequences. The following definition will be used
to classify fighting: Caused, attempted to cause, or threatened to cause physical injury to another person or willfully
used force or violence upon another person, except in self-defense.

                                                         34
        NOTICE OF PROHIBITION OF ALCOHOL, TOBACCO AND OTHER DRUGS
        We believe that involvement with, and/or use of controlled substances will seriously impair students’ ability to
        achieve academically and to live healthy lives. Schools in the Fortune network will not tolerate the possession,
        use, or sale of alcohol, tobacco, or drugs on school campuses, at school-sponsored events, or while representing
        the school in any capacity in any location.


                                                    DISCIPLINE MATRIX

The purpose of this matrix is to ensure that our schools are a safe and orderly environment in which learning is not jeopardized
by disruptions. Each teacher provides students with a clear set of classroom rules and expectations and will administer
consequences for minor offenses within the classroom. A discipline referral will result if students do not correct classroom
misbehavior. The following matrix contains consequences that shall be administered if classroom behavior is not corrected or
more serious actions occur. The type of discipline will depend upon the student’s disciplinary background and the seriousness
of the student’s action. The disciplinary action outlined below serves as the required disciplinary action to be taken by
administration. The Principal may not modify disciplinary action at their discretion. Other actions not listed will be reviewed on
a case-by-case basis. Multiple or repetitive violations of behavior rules may result in suspension and/or expulsion. All
documentation required under the Discipline Matrix will become part of the scholar’s disciplinary record.

A student may be suspended or expelled for prohibited misconduct as set forth in the Suspension and Expulsion Policy and the
Discipline Matrix below, if the act is related to school activity or school attendance occurring at any time including but not
limited to: a) while on school grounds; b) while going to or coming from school; c) during the lunch period, whether on or off
the school campus; d) during, going to, or coming from a school-sponsored activity.

Plagiarism / Cheating
Plagiarism occurs when a student uses another writer’s work without giving credit for the source.
Plagiarism typically occurs in school situations in the following ways:
    • A student uses the author’s words without using quote marks around the material.
    • A student uses an electronic source (internet, TV, lyrics) without citing the source.
    • A student uses the author’s ideas or information without giving credit for the material (known in the
         academic world as “citing the source”).
    • A student does both—uses the author’s words and ideas without citing the source.
Cheating can take many forms but always involves taking information from another student or individual.
Examples of cheating can include but are not limited to:
    • taking answers on a test, homework, or quiz from another student or other source, with or without the
         other student’s knowledge;
    • collaboration on assignments such as taking or sharing answers without teacher permission;
    • obtaining test answers and/or questions from other students in advance of an exam;
    • stealing test materials from a teacher’s belongings;
    • falsifying grade reports or changing a grade book;
    • taking pictures of an exam and forwarding the pictures to anyone;
                                                           45
    • texting answers or questions to anyone.
Cheating can be accomplished by several means, including but not limited to: deception, theft, talking, signs,
gestures, copying, use of unpermitted study aids such as “cheat sheets,” and threats to other students.

 CODE OF CONDUCT
 Students and parents/guardians are expected to conduct themselves in an orderly, courteous, dignified and
 respectful manner. This requirement refers to their actions toward other students, teachers, and adults within the
 school including their language, dress and manners.

 We believe self-discipline is key to individual success. Students and parents have a responsibility to know and
 respect the policies, rules and expectations of the school. Violations of such policies, rules and regulations will
 result in disciplinary action. School authorities have authorization to employ probation and suspension and to
 recommend expulsion, if necessary, to enforce this policy.

 Parents/guardians and adult family members who fail to meet the school’s standards of conduct will be banned
 from campus for an amount of time determined by school administration. A ban from campus may be permanent
 at the discretion of school administration.

 Application of the policies contained in this handbook regarding student conduct are in effect during the following
 times and in the following places:
     • On school grounds during, and immediately before or immediately after school hours
     • On school grounds at any other time when the school is being used by a school group
     • Off school grounds at a school activity, function or event

TITLE IX, HARASSMENT, INTIMIDATION, DISCRIMINATION, AND BULLYING POLICY
 Discrimination, sexual harassment, harassment, intimidation, and bullying are all disruptive behaviors, which
 interfere with students’ ability to learn, negatively affect student engagement, diminish school safety, and contribute
 to a hostile school environment. As such, Fortune School (“Charter School”) prohibits any acts of discrimination,
 sexual harassment, harassment, intimidation, and bullying altogether. This policy is inclusive of instances that occur
 on any area of the school campus, at school-sponsored events and activities, regardless of location, through school-
 owned technology, and through other electronic means.

 As used in this policy, discrimination, sexual harassment, harassment, intimidation, and bullying are described as
 the intentional conduct, including verbal, physical, written communication or cyber-bullying, including cyber sexual
 bullying, based on the actual or perceived characteristics of mental or physical disability, sex (including pregnancy
 and related conditions, and parental status), sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, gender expression,
 immigration status, nationality (including national origin, country of origin, and citizenship), race or ethnicity
 (including ancestry, color, ethnic group identification, ethnic background, and traits historically associated with
 race, including, but not limited to, hair texture and protective hairstyles such as braids, locks, and twist), religion
 (including agnosticism and atheism), religious affiliation, medical condition, genetic information, marital status, age
 or association with a person or group with one or more of these actual or perceived characteristics or based on
 any other characteristic protected under applicable state or federal law or local ordinance. Hereafter, such actions
 are referred to as “misconduct prohibited by this Policy.”



                                                           47
To the extent possible, the Charter School will make reasonable efforts to prevent students from being
discriminated against, harassed, intimidated, and/or bullied, and will take action to investigate, respond, address
and report on such behaviors in a timely manner. Fortune School staff who witness acts of misconduct prohibited
by this Policy will take immediate steps to intervene when safe to do so.

Moreover, the Charter School will not condone or tolerate misconduct prohibited by this Policy by any employee,
independent contractor or other person with whom Fortune School does business, or any other individual,
student, or volunteer. This Policy applies to all employees, students, or volunteer actions and relationships,
regardless of position or gender. Fortune School will promptly and thoroughly investigate and respond to any
complaint of misconduct prohibited by this Policy in a manner that is not deliberately indifferent and will take
appropriate corrective action, if warranted. Fortune School complies with all applicable state and federal laws and
regulations and local ordinances in its investigation of and response to reports of misconduct prohibited by this
Policy.

rejection of, the conduct by the individual is used as the basis of employment, educational or academic decisions
affecting the individual; (c) the conduct has the purpose or effect of having a negative impact upon the individual’s
work or academic performance, or of creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work or educational
environment; and/or (d) submission to, or rejection of, the conduct by the individual is used as the basis for any
decision affecting the individual regarding benefits and services, honors, programs, or activities available at or
through the educational institution.

                      activity for compensation or reward or deferential treatment for rejecting sexual conduct.
                 o Subjecting or threats of subjecting a student or employee to unwelcome sexual attention or
                      conduct or intentionally making the student’s or employee’s performance more difficult
                      because of the student’s or the employee’s sex.
        •    Sexual or discriminatory displays or publications anywhere in the work or educational environment,
             such as:
                 o Displaying pictures, cartoons, posters, calendars, graffiti, objections, promotional materials,

Bullying and Cyberbullying Prevention Procedures
Fortune School has adopted the following procedures for preventing acts of bullying, including cyberbullying.

    1. Cyberbullying Prevention Procedures
       Fortune School advises students:
                a. To never share passwords, personal data, or private photos online.
                b. To think about what they are doing carefully before posting and by emphasizing that comments
                   cannot be retracted once they are posted.
                c. That personal information revealed on social media can be shared with anyone including
                   parents, teachers, administrators, and potential employers. Students should never reveal
                   information that would make them uncomfortable if the world had access to it.
                d. To consider how it would feel receiving such comments before making comments about
                   others online.
       Fortune School informs Charter School employees, students, and parents/guardians of Fortune School’s
       policies regarding the use of technology in and out of the classroom. Fortune School encourages
       parents/guardians to discuss these policies with their children to ensure their children understand and
       comply with such policies.

    2. Education
       Fortune School employees cannot always be present when bullying incidents occur, so educating students
       about bullying is a key prevention technique to limit bullying from happening. Fortune School advises
       students that hateful and/or demeaning behavior is inappropriate and unacceptable in our society and at
       Fortune School and encourages students to practice compassion and respect each other.

        Charter School educates students to accept all student peers regardless of protected characteristics
        (including but not limited to actual or perceived sexual orientation, gender identification, physical or
        cognitive disabilities, race, ethnicity, religion, and immigration status) and about the negative impact of
        bullying other students based on protected characteristics.

        Fortune School’s bullying prevention education also discusses the differences between appropriate and
        inappropriate behaviors and includes sample situations to help students learn and practice appropriate
        behavior and to develop techniques and strategies to respond in a non-aggressive way to bullying-type
        behaviors. Students will also develop confidence and learn how to advocate for themselves and others,
        and when to go to an adult for help.

        Fortune School informs Fortune School employees, students, and parents/guardians of this Policy and
        encourages parents/guardians to discuss this Policy with their children to ensure their children understand
        and comply with this Policy.

    3. Professional Development
       Fortune School annually makes available the online training module developed by the California
       Department of Education pursuant Education Code section 32283.5(a) to its certificated employees and
       all other Fortune School employees who have regular interaction with students. Fortune School informs
       certificated employees about the common signs that a student is a target of bullying including:
            • Physical cuts or injuries
            • Lost or broken personal items
            • Fear of going to school/practice/games
            • Loss of interest in school, activities, or friends
            • Trouble sleeping or eating
            • Anxious/sick/nervous behavior or distracted appearance
            • Self-destructiveness or displays of odd behavior
            • Decreased self-esteem

        Charter School also informs certificated employees about the groups of students determined by Fortune
        School, and available research, to be at elevated risk for bullying. These groups include but are not limited
        to:
            • Students who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or questioning youth (“LGBTQ”) and those
                youth perceived as LGBTQ; and
            • Students with physical or learning disabilities.

        Fortune School encourages its employees to demonstrate effective problem-solving, anger management,
        and self-confidence skills for Fortune School’s students.

Grievance Procedures
1. Scope of Grievance Procedures
Fortune School will comply with its Uniform Complaint Procedures (“UCP”) policy when investigating and
responding to complaints alleging unlawful harassment, discrimination, intimidation or bullying against a protected
group or on the basis of a person’s association with a person or group with one or more of the protected
characteristics set forth in the UCP that:
    a. Are written and signed;
    b. Filed by an individual who alleges that that individual has personally suffered unlawful discrimination,
        harassment, intimidation or bullying, or by one who believes any specific class of individuals has been
        subjected to discrimination, harassment, intimidation or bullying prohibited by this part, or by a duly
        authorized representative who alleges that an individual student has been subjected to discrimination,
        harassment, intimidation, or bullying; and
    c. Submitted to the Fortune School UCP Compliance Officer not later than six (6) months from the date
        the alleged unlawful discrimination, harassment, intimidation or bullying occurred, or the date the
        complainant first obtained knowledge of the facts of the alleged discrimination, harassment, intimidation
        or bullying.

                                                        51
The following grievance procedures shall be utilized for reports of misconduct prohibited by this Policy that do
not comply with the writing, timeline, or other formal filing requirements of a uniform complaint. For formal
complaints of sexual harassment, Fortune School will utilize the following grievance procedures in addition to its
UCP when applicable.

2. Reporting
All staff are expected to provide appropriate supervision to enforce standards of conduct and, if they observe or
become aware of misconduct prohibited by this Policy, to intervene when safe to do so, call for assistance, and
report such incidents. The Board requires staff to follow the procedures in this policy for reporting alleged acts
of misconduct prohibited by this Policy.

Any student who believes they have been subject to misconduct prohibited by this Policy or has witnessed such
prohibited misconduct is encouraged to immediately report such misconduct to the Coordinator:

                                  Michelle Grace, Chief Operating Officer
                                        Fortune School of Education
                   2890 Gateway Oaks Drive., #100 | Sacramento, CA | 95833 | (916) 924-8633
                                 COORDINATOR@FORTUNESCHOOL.US

Complaints regarding such misconduct may also be made to the U.S. Department of Education, Office for Civil
Rights. Civil law remedies, including, but not limited to, injunctions, restraining orders, or other remedies or
orders may also be available to complainants.

While submission of a written report is not required, the reporting party is encouraged to submit a written report
to the Coordinator. Fortune School will investigate and respond to all oral and written reports of misconduct
prohibited by this Policy in a manner that is not deliberately indifferent. Reports may be made anonymously, but
formal disciplinary action cannot be based solely on an anonymous report.

Students are expected to report all incidents of misconduct prohibited by this Policy or other verbal, or physical
abuses. Any student who feels they are a target of such behavior should immediately contact a teacher, counselor,
the Principal, Coordinator, a staff person or a family member so that the student can get assistance in resolving
the issue in a manner that is consistent with this Policy.

Fortune School acknowledges and respects every individual’s right to privacy. All reports shall be investigated in a
manner that protects the confidentiality of the parties and the integrity of the process to the greatest extent
possible. This includes keeping the identity of the reporter confidential, as appropriate, except to the extent
necessary to comply with the law, carry out the investigation and/or to resolve the issue, as determined by the
Coordinator or administrative designee on a case-by-case basis.

Fortune School prohibits any form of retaliation against any individual who files a report or complaint, testifies,
assists, participates, or refuses to participate in any investigation or proceeding related to misconduct prohibited
by this Policy. Such participation or lack of participation shall not in any way affect the status, grades, or work
assignments of the individual. Individuals alleging retaliation in violation of this Policy may file a grievance using the
procedures set forth in this Policy. Knowingly making false statements or knowingly submitting false information
during the grievance process is prohibited and may result in disciplinary action.

All supervisors of staff will receive sexual harassment training within six (6) months of their assumption of a
supervisory position and will receive further training once every two (2) years thereafter. All staff, and any
individual designated as a coordinator, investigator or decision-maker will receive sexual harassment training
and/or instruction concerning sexual harassment as required by law.

3. Supportive Measures
Upon the receipt of an informal or formal complaint of sexual harassment, the Coordinator will promptly contact
the complainant to discuss the availability of supportive measures. The Coordinator will consider the complainant’s
wishes with respect to supportive measures, inform the complainant of the availability of supportive measures


                                                           52
with or without the filing of a formal complaint of sexual harassment, and explain the process for filing a formal
complaint of sexual harassment.

Supportive measures are non-disciplinary, non-punitive individualized services offered as appropriate, as
reasonably available, and without fee or charge to the complainant or the respondent before or after the filing of
a formal complaint of sexual harassment or where no formal complaint of sexual harassment has been filed. Such
measures are designed to restore or preserve equal access to Fortune School’s education program or activity
without unreasonably burdening the other party, including measures designed to protect the safety of all parties
or Fortune School’s educational environment, or deter sexual harassment. Supportive measures available to
complainants and respondents may include but are not limited to counseling, extensions of deadlines or other
course-related adjustments, modifications of work or class schedules, campus escort services, mutual restrictions
on contact between the parties, changes in work locations, leaves of absence, increased security and monitoring
of certain areas of the campus, and other similar measures. Fortune School will maintain as confidential any
supportive measures provided to the complainant or respondent, to the extent that maintaining such
confidentiality would not impair the ability of Fortune School to provide the supportive measures.

4. Investigation and Response
Upon receipt of a report of misconduct prohibited by this Policy from a student, staff member, parent, volunteer,
visitor or affiliate of Fortune School, the Coordinator (or administrative designee) will promptly initiate an
investigation. In most cases, a thorough investigation will take no more than twenty-five (25) school days. If the
Coordinator (or administrative designee) determines that an investigation will take longer than twenty-five (25)
school days and needs to be delayed or extended due to good cause, the Coordinator (or administrative designee)
will inform the complainant of the reasons for the delay or extension and provide an approximate date when the
investigation will be complete.

At the conclusion of the investigation, the Coordinator (or administrative designee) will meet with the complainant
and, to the extent possible with respect to confidentiality laws, provide the complainant with information about
the investigation, including any actions necessary to resolve the incident/situation. However, the Coordinator (or
administrative designee) will not reveal confidential information related to other students or employees.

For investigations of and responses to formal complaints of sexual harassment, the following grievance procedures
will apply:
     • Notice of the Allegations
             o Upon receipt of a formal complaint of sexual harassment, the Coordinator will give all known
                 parties written notice of its grievance process, including any voluntary informal resolution process.
                 The notice will include:
                     ▪ A description of the allegations of sexual harassment at issue and to the extent known,
                         the identities of the parties involved in the incident, the conduct allegedly constituting
                         sexual harassment, and the date and location of the alleged incident;
                     ▪ A statement that the respondent is presumed not responsible for the alleged conduct
                         until a final decision is reached;
                     ▪ A statement that the parties may have an advisor of their choice, who may be an attorney,
                         and may inspect and review evidence; and
                     ▪ A statement that Fortune School prohibits an individual from knowingly making false
                         statements or knowingly submitting false information during the grievance process.
     • Emergency Removal
             o Fortune School may place a non-student employee respondent on administrative leave during the
                 pendency of a formal complaint of sexual harassment grievance process in accordance with
                 Fortune School’s policies.
             o Fortune School may remove a respondent from Fortune School’s education program or activity
                 on an emergency basis, in accordance with Fortune School’s policies, provided that Fortune School
                 undertakes an individualized safety and risk analysis, determines that an immediate threat to the
                 physical health or safety of any student or other individual arising from the allegations of sexual
                 harassment justifies removal, and provides the respondent with notice and an opportunity to
                 challenge the decision immediately following the removal.


                                                         53
        o    This provision may not be construed to modify any rights under the IDEA, Section 504, or the
             ADA.
•   Informal Resolution
        o If a formal complaint of sexual harassment is filed, Fortune School may offer a voluntary informal
             resolution process, such as mediation, to the parties at any time prior to reaching a determination
             regarding responsibility. If Fortune School offers such a process, it will do the following:
                 ▪ Provide the parties with advance written notice of:
                      • The allegations;
                      • The requirements of the voluntary informal resolution process including the
                          circumstances under which the parties are precluded from resuming a formal
                          complaint of sexual harassment arising from the same allegations;
                      • The parties’ right to withdraw from the voluntary informal resolution process and
                          resume the grievance process at any time prior to agreeing to a resolution; and
                      • Any consequences resulting from participating in the voluntary informal resolution
                          process, including the records that will be maintained or could be shared; and
             ▪ Obtain the parties’ advance voluntary, written consent to the informal resolution process.
    o Fortune School will not offer or facilitate an informal resolution process to resolve allegations that an
        employee sexually harassed a student.
•   Investigation Process
        o The decision-maker will not be the same person(s) as the Coordinator or the investigator.
             Fortune School shall ensure that all decision-makers and investigators do not have a conflict of
             interest or bias for or against complainants or respondents.
        o In most cases, a thorough investigation will take no more than twenty-five (25) school days. If the
             investigator determines that an investigation will take longer than twenty-five (25) school days and
             needs to be delayed or extended due to good cause, the investigator will inform the complainant
             and any respondents in writing of the reasons for the delay or extension and provide an
             approximate date when the investigation will be complete.
        o The parties will be provided with an equal opportunity to present witnesses, to inspect and review
             any evidence obtained that is directly related to the allegations raised, and to have an advisor
             present during any investigative meeting or interview.
        o The parties will not be prohibited from discussing the allegations under investigation or to gather
             and present relevant evidence.
        o A party whose participation is invited or expected at an investigative meeting or interview will
             receive written notice of the date, time, location, participants, and purpose of the meeting or
             interview with sufficient time for the party to prepare to participate.
        o Prior to completion of the investigative report, Fortune School will send to each party and the
             party’s advisor, if any, a copy of the evidence subject to inspection and review, and the parties will
             have at least ten (10) days to submit a written response for the investigator’s consideration prior
             to the completion of the investigation report.
        o The investigator will complete an investigation report that fairly summarizes all relevant evidence
             and send a copy of the report to each party and the party’s advisor, if any, at least ten (10) days
             prior to the determination of responsibility.
•   Dismissal of a Formal Complaint of Sexual Harassment
        o If the investigation reveals that the alleged harassment did not occur in Fortune School’s
             educational program in the United States or would not constitute sexual harassment even if
             proved, the formal complaint with regard to that conduct must be dismissed. However, such a
             dismissal does not preclude action under another applicable Fortune School policy.
        o Fortune School may dismiss a formal complaint of sexual harassment if:
                 ▪ The complainant provides a written withdrawal of the complaint to the Coordinator;
                 ▪ The respondent is no longer employed or enrolled at Fortune School; or
                 ▪ The specific circumstances prevent Fortune School from gathering evidence sufficient to
                      reach a decision on the formal complaint or the allegations therein.
        o If a formal complaint of sexual harassment or any of the claims therein are dismissed, Fortune
             School will promptly send written notice of the dismissal and the reason(s) for the dismissal
             simultaneously to the parties.
•   Determination of Responsibility
                                                        54
            o   The standard of evidence used to determine responsibility is the preponderance of the evidence
                standard.
            o   Determinations will be based on an objective evaluation of all relevant evidence and credibility
                determinations will not be based on a person’s status as a complainant, respondent, or witness.
            o   Fortune School will send a written decision on the formal complaint to the complainant and
                respondent simultaneously that describes:
                    ▪ The allegations in the formal complaint of sexual harassment;
                    ▪ All procedural steps taken including any notifications to the parties, interviews with parties
                        and witnesses, site visits, and methods used to gather other evidence;
                    ▪ The findings of facts supporting the determination;
                    ▪ The conclusions about the application of Fortune School’s code of conduct to the facts;
                    ▪ The decision and rationale for each allegation;
                    ▪ Any disciplinary sanctions the recipient imposes on the respondent, and whether
                        remedies designed to restore or preserve equal access to the education program or
                        activity will be provided to the complainant; and
                    ▪ The procedures and permissible bases for appeals.

5. Consequences
Students or employees who engage in misconduct prohibited by this Policy, knowingly make false statements or
knowingly submit false information during the grievance process may be subject to disciplinary action up to and
including expulsion from Fortune School or termination of employment. The Coordinator is responsible for
effective implementation of any remedies ordered by Fortune School in response to a formal complaint of sexual
harassment.

6. Right of Appeal
Should the reporting individual find Fortune School’s resolution unsatisfactory, the reporting individual may, within
five (5) business days of notice of Fortune School’s decision or resolution, submit a written appeal to the President
of the Fortune School Board, who will review the investigation and render a final decision.

The following appeal rights and procedures will also apply to formal complaints of sexual harassment:
    • The complainant and the respondent shall have the same appeal rights and Fortune School will implement
         appeal procedures equally for both parties.
    • Fortune School will notify the other party in writing when an appeal is filed.
    • The decision-maker for the appeal will give both parties a reasonable, equal opportunity to submit a
         written statement in support of, or challenging, the outcome; issue a written decision describing the result
         of the appeal and the rationale for the result; and provide the written decision simultaneously to both
         parties.

7. Recordkeeping
All records related to any investigation of complaints under this Policy are maintained in a secure location.
Fortune School will maintain the following records for at least seven (7) years:
     • Records of each sexual harassment investigation, including any determination of responsibility; any audio
         or audiovisual recording or transcript; any disciplinary sanctions imposed on the respondent; and any
         remedies provided to the complainant.
     • Records of any appeal of a formal sexual harassment complaint and the results of that appeal.
     • Records of any informal resolution of a sexual harassment complaint and the results of that informal
         resolution.
     • All materials used to train Title IX coordinators, investigators, decision-makers, and any person who
         facilitates an informal resolution process.
     • Records of any actions, including any supportive measures, taken in response to a report or formal
         complaint of sexual harassment.
